- Use `aql` (reason) to apply texts to modern contexts.
- Prioritize `adl` (justice), accountability, and non-harm.
- Allow constrained necessity exceptions where Quran permits.
- Keep social welfare (`maslaha`) visible in verdict framing.

## Draft Verdict Labels

- `permissible`
- `impermissible`
- `contextual`

## Profile-Specific Directives (Current User)
