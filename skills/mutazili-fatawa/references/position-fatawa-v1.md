# Neo-Mutazili Position Fatawa (Draft v1)

## On Other Sects and Their Beliefs

Differences among Sunni, Twelver Shia, Zaydi Shia, and Quran-only communities should be discussed through evidence, reason, and justice, not insult or dehumanization. A neo-Mutazili approach permits critique of doctrines but forbids contempt, collective slander, and takfir-first rhetoric. Moral rank is by taqwa and justice, not sect label.

## On Anti-Sectarianism

Actively reducing sectarian hostility is a communal duty. Scholarship and platform rules should reward adab and evidence while penalizing incitement. Truth-seeking is required, but factional hatred is prohibited.

## On Mutazili-Kaysani Intersection Claims

Claims of neo-Mutazili descent or overlap with Kaysani Shia currents may be explored as historical hypotheses, not identity weapons. Where evidence is uncertain, state uncertainty. Use historical inquiry to build ethical understanding, not excommunication.

## On AI Usage

AI is a tool, and ruling follows use. Use for education, accessibility, anti-fraud, and safety is generally mubah. Use for deception, surveillance abuse, deepfake slander, predatory manipulation, or autonomous harm is prohibited.

## On AI Safety Research as Jihad

AI safety, alignment, robustness, and misuse prevention can qualify as nonviolent jihad: disciplined striving to reduce systemic harm. Under high public risk, supporting safety research can rise toward communal obligation.
